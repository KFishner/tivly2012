    <h2>Why should I enter my payment card information?</h2>
    <h5>Entering your payment card information allows us to give you free stuff. The recommendations that friends send you are accompanied by discounts, which can only be redeemed through your credit card. Your information is kept completely secure on a server that protects your information with PCI compliant bank-level security.</h5>
    <h2>How do I redeem my rewards?</h2>
    <h5>Just swipe your registered payment card at the business where you have a reward. For example, if you have a $10 reward and buy $100 worth of clothes at Mataylor's Avenue, just swipe your registered payment card at checkout, and your will be charged only $90. We know Ñ it's really cool. Never again worry about remembering to use paper or mobile coupons!</h5>
    <h2>What kinds of rewards can I get through Tivly?</h2>
    <h5>All kinds! The loyalty rewards are completely customized by the restaurants, so tell your favorite places what rewards you want to see!</h5>
